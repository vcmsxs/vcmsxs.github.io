    /#Vers - Intro/

    /#1/
    The body is old but the head is fine
    The car reeks of tobacco and Spanish wine
    It's eluding, why were they made?
    And how far from the pack have I strayed
    I stay up late, I need to observe
    I am still, very much, on the learning curve
    Their tantrums come and go, without warning
    It's written, Joy cometh in the morning.

    /Ref(1):/
    Yes I am a fool of course I am a snob.
    This is not the time to quit my day job.
    Stuck on the freeway in a blue Range Rover.
    My children drive me crazy. Please pull over.

    /#2/
    Lose some weight and cross that bridge
    But the light is always on in my fridge.
    Maybe it is time for a vacation.
    Let my tallest finger give a standing ovation.
    Most likely it is my fault, I got what I deserve
    I am still, on the learning curve
    This crying boy in the back is my son
    Let your smile be your umbrella, little one

    /Vers: Solo/

    /Ref(1):/

    /#3/
    They long for sky, I made them earth bound.
    Sorry to say these things will never get off the ground
    This globe was a perfect orbital station
    And they fuck it up with their first generation
    I try to shake it of, and show a little nerve
    I am so very much stuck on the learning curve?
    My angels are flying around, having fun.
    But my children won't play nice under the sun.

    /Ref(2):/
    So here comes the fool and I am your snob.
    This might be the right time to quit my day job.
    My turn to find and pick the four leaf clover.
    Childen, you're driving me crazy. Please pull over.

    /Vers - Utro - Solo/
