      The mandatory hand shake
      he is standing a little too close
      Nice to meet you, You must be
      Mr Stand Up Steve, I suppose?
      They force you to listen
      And push needles through your skin
      Be on your toes or they will suck you dry
      of everything within

      It's coming down in Tchad
      There are cats and dogs over Maine
      Let it rain
      It pours down inside
      with the roar of train.
      Let it rain.


      /#Stick/
      All aboard, Mind the Gap
      Come and sit, in my lap
      Surely you can take some more
      We have been here before
      Now the train leaves the station
      There is no known destination
      But it's not a friendly nation
      An air of desperation

      Smile and nod when they brag
      Laugh at jokes, salute their flag
      The game is on, you can't abort
      They will have their day in court
      Swallow the pain, Let it rain
      Let it rain

      /#2/
      Yes! let's rant and rave
      over things that doesn't matter.
      Nice to meet you, you must be
      Miss Olivia the organizer, I gather?
      If it had been a little bit colder in here
      It would have come down as snow
      Please stop shiver and shatter those teeth.
      Now get in the boat and row!

      There's flooding in Tokyo
      A hurricane over Spain
      Let it rain
      It pours down inside
      You buy umbrellas in vain
      Let it rain.

      /#3/
      The smell is unbearable.
      That is one unholy perfume
      Hi, so nice to meet you
      You are the devil himself, I presume.
      Please turn this hall up side down
      And shake it like a tambourine
      They will rip us apart
      And stitch us up, with a sewing machine

      There is a downpour over Denver
      And a tsunami over Bahrain
      Let it rain
      It pours down inside
      It's washing through my brain
      Let it rain.
